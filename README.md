Unity 7:
For this assignment we were asked to add moveable blocks, collectable items, a general inventory system that was connected to a UI to show the items we collected, and reconfigure our old scoring script to work with out new UI. I was able to get all but that very last one working. I got a moveable block in the game, hard to reach green block at the top, that is moevable and is going to because more usable in the future. I added coins (and a fake coin for testing that's just a yellow orb) that can be collected. At the moment when one player pick it up, it shows for both players instead of that one, and I plan to fix that in the future. But I don't expect to lose points on that since there was nothing in the instructions or in class saying we had to have them separated yet, just implemented into the game with the UI working.
Now I got almost all of part 3 done. i got all the scripts downloaded and made sure they worked with my previous scripts. I couldn't however get my old scripts rewroked properly *yet* to have them *completely* work on the new UI. I tried many times, asked friends to help and even went into the lab on Saturday to figure it out, but nothing I did would make it work. So what I decided to turn it in like this. Everything is functioning perfectly independently, and all the scripts, moving object and coins that needed to be added have been.
If you have any suggestions on how to fix my problem please let me know.

Unity 6:
I added in the two scoring systems and the winner text by making the new UIManager scripts. Player 1's score is displayed top left and Player 2's is top right. I made sure they each said the same thing and kept saying the same thing even as the score went up. I also made sure they were visible, but not too big or distracting.
Then, for the winner score I added into the UI manager scripts, and made sure it was really big and bright, and only displayed once 5 points were hit by a player. 

Unity 5:
For my Unity 5 Leapfrog game, I decided the iterations I would make would visual focussed. I did this for two reasons. 
1 being that I think a lot of people assume the only "proper" iterations to a game must be in the game functions themselves, which are great, but isn't true.
the 2nd and more honest answer is that i was unable to attend class on the monday where we started this project, and have had continuous issues with the code trying to get it to work.
Eventually figured out what was wrong all on my own, and I'm proud of myself, but was also kinda exhausted at that point.
So my smaller change to the appearance is making the players a similar color to the flooring, making it a bit more challenging to tell where they are.
The biggest change I made is definitely the the scale and "visibility" of the playing field. The scale of the map is pretty big, giving you both a lot of places to go, but also giving you a possibly farther distance to travel to reach your goal (jumping over the other player)
the arena also has "covers" on the perimeters and towards the center of the space for two purposes. The smaller white covers allow the player a spot to hide where the other player will be unable to jump over them because of how big the covers are. 
The downside to the covers however is that it also prevents the person hiding from getting points also. So there is a Decision making aspect of whether to hide under them, but also an incentive not to because it adds the constraint that neither will be able to gain points, thus a stalemate.
The bigger covers on the perimeters of the arena allow for a larger hiding space, but are also taller, meaning if the other player knows where you are hiding they can still jump over you and get a point. This gives you Chance and Untertainty because the covers make it very hard to guess where you or the other player is, 
but the arean is only so big and there is always the option they jump over you.
